# Bank Account Project

## Description
This project was developed for my Object-Oriented Programming class. It defines a class that represents a bank account, including attributes for the owner's name, account number, and balance. The class also includes methods for performing common banking activities such as deposit, withdrawal, and retrieving account statements.

## Language Used
- Python

## How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Run the `bank_account.py` file in your terminal.
2. You can create instances of the `BankAccount` class and test various methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`, and `print_statement`.

Feel free to update or create new instances to explore the functionality!
